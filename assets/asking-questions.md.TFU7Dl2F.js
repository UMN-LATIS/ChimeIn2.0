Multiple choice and slider response questions are great choices for quick in class comprehension checks. They are easy to make quickly in class, and students can answer in a few seconds. Free response questions and image uploads require more time on the students’ part, so these options are great for reflecting on learning and even allowing students to answer the question outside of class. Questions with long prompts and/or long multiple choice answers should be prepared prior to the start of class to keep class running smoothly. If ChimeIn questions should appear in the Canvas gradebook, instructors should make ChimeIn assignments in <a href="./canvas.html">Canvas</a> before class. This process is fairly simple, but does take more time than just creating a question in class.</p><p>Questions can include links, images, numbered and bulleted lists, as well as standard typographical emphasis options, allowing for a wide variety of question options.</p><h2 id="adding-questions" tabindex="-1">Adding Questions <a class="header-anchor" href="#adding-questions" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Adding Questions&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Questions are stored inside of folders.

In this case, participant names won&#39;t be displayed in association with their responses. Keep in mind that identity information is still tracked on the ChimeIn server, so this is not an acceptable option for collecting truly anonymous data.</p><h2 id="question-types" tabindex="-1">Question Types <a class="header-anchor" href="#question-types" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Question Types&quot;">​</a></h2><p>ChimeIn currently has 5 question types.

Questions with short prompts and answers can be written in class, while questions with long prompts and detailed answers should be written prior to the start of class. If you check the box for &quot;allow multiple responses&quot;, participants will be able to select more than one option.</p><p>You can <strong>optionally</strong> select a &quot;correct&quot; answer or answers for a question by checking the box to the left of the response text. The correct answer will be marked with a check in the results display. You can also <a href="./managing-a-chime.html">optionally have only correct answers passed to Canvas</a> when using the Canvas integration.</p><h4 id="written-in-class" tabindex="-1">Written in class <a class="header-anchor" href="#written-in-class" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Written in class&quot;">​</a></h4><ul><li><p>What year was the Chinese Exclusion Act passed?</p><ul><li>1885</li><li>1882</li><li>1892</li><li>1888</li></ul></li><li><p>Alexander Hamilton was the first ____?
