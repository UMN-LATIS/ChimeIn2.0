The biggest change is that ChimeIn 2 no longer relies on course enrollment data to provide access. Historically, this has been the biggest pain-point for faculty - enrollment data can be out of date or incorrect, and it could be complicated to track down issues.</p><p>ChimeIn 2 also uses some new language. ChimeIn has been used in many non-course situations, so the course-centric interface created confusion. In ChimeIn 2, you create <em>chimes</em>. Chimes contain folders, and folders contain questions. You&#39;ll never enter a &quot;course designator&quot; or any other course-specific information.</p><p>If you&#39;d like some personal help migrating from the old ChimeIn to the new, please <a href="mailto:latistecharch@umn.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">contact us</a>. One important note: ChimeIn 2 doesn&#39;t support a text-messaging interface for non-smartphone interaction. This was both unreliable and expensive in the old ChimeIn, and was very rarely used.</p><h2 id="using-chimein-2-with-a-course" tabindex="-1">Using ChimeIn 2 with a course <a class="header-anchor" href="#using-chimein-2-with-a-course" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>We&#39;re currently testing our <a href="./canvas.html">Canvas</a> integration, which dramatically simplifies using ChimeIn with a course. Although that&#39;s not yet available for everyone, you can still use ChimeIn with a course. See the <a href="./managing-a-chime.html">Managing a Chime</a> section for more information on the basics of setting up a Chime and sharing links.</p><p>If you&#39;re not using the Canvas integration, you&#39;ll want to create a Chime, and then share the unique URL or access code with your participants.</p><h2 id="other-changes-with-chimein-2" tabindex="-1">Other Changes with ChimeIn 2 <a class="header-anchor" href="#other-changes-with-chimein-2" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>The process for using ChimeIn 2 to ask questions is very similar to the original version. Participants just leave their browser open on page for your Chime and questions will appear automatically when you &quot;open&quot; them. ChimeIn 2 provides a &quot;present&quot; mode which can be used fullscreen, to better facilitate asking questions in class.</p>',9),r=[o];function s(h,c,l,m,u,d){return n(),i("div",null,r)}const f=e(a,[["render",s]]);export{p as __pageData,f as default};
