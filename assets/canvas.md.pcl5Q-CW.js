You&#39;ve got two options - you can either have a single gradebook entry for all of your ChimeIn responses, or you can have multiple assignments each with its own gradebook entry. You can also choose not to have any grades.</p><h2 id="approaches-to-using-chimein-within-canvas" tabindex="-1">Approaches to using ChimeIn within Canvas <a class="header-anchor" href="#approaches-to-using-chimein-within-canvas" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Approaches to using ChimeIn within Canvas&quot;">​</a></h2><p>If you&#39;re using ChimeIn repeatedly throughout a course, there are a couple different approaches to setting up your Canvas course. If you&#39;d like to keep track of student participation on a weekly or per-lecture basis, you should create separate assignments. Just repeat the steps in the previous section each time. That way, the gradebook will reflect participation in individual course sessions. Alternatively, you can create a single assignment for an entire semester, and collect an overall grade. If you&#39;d like to discuss different approaches, just <a href="mailto:latistecharch@umn.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">contact us</a>.</p><h2 id="presenting-to-students" tabindex="-1">Presenting to students <a class="header-anchor" href="#presenting-to-students" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Presenting to students&quot;">​</a></h2><p>When you&#39;re ready to share your questions with your students, remind them to follow the assignment link within Canvas. <strong>This is important in order for them to receive credit in the gradebook.</strong> As the instructor, you can follow the same link to present the questions. At that point, the process is the same as presenting ChimeIn outside of Canvas. We&#39;ve got a <a href="./cheatsheet.html">step by step cheatsheet you can refer to</a>.</p><p>ChimeIn grades will be updated in Canvas approximately 3 hours after the last response is received. This is done to ensure that students don&#39;t get flooded with &quot;grade update&quot; notifications during a class.
