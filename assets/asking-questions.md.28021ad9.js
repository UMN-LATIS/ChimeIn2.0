Multiple choice and slider response questions are great choices for quick in class comprehension checks. They are easy to make quickly in class, and students can answer in a few seconds. Free response questions and image uploads require more time on the students\u2019 part, so these options are great for reflecting on learning and even allowing students to answer the question outside of class. Questions with long prompts and/or long multiple choice answers should be prepared prior to the start of class to keep class running smoothly. If ChimeIn questions should appear in the Canvas gradebook, instructors should make ChimeIn assignments in <a href="./canvas.html">Canvas</a> before class. This process is fairly simple, but does take more time than just creating a question in class.</p><p>Questions can include links, images, numbered and bulleted lists, as well as standard typographical emphasis options, allowing for a wide variety of question options.</p><h2 id="adding-questions" tabindex="-1">Adding Questions <a class="header-anchor" href="#adding-questions" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>Questions are stored inside of folders.

In this case, participant names won&#39;t be displayed in association with their responses.
