Think of it as a web-based &quot;clicker&quot; tool, but with advanced features that aren&#39;t possible with traditional clickers. ChimeIn can be used in classes, but it can also be used for meetings, conferences, or any type of event in which you want to collect feedback. ChimeIn can also be used both synchronously and asynchronously.</p><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Migrating from the original ChimeIn?</p><p>Check out our <a href="./moving-to-chimein-2.html">moving to ChimeIn 2</a> page or <a href="mailto:latistecharch@umn.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">contact us</a> for a personal introduction</p></div><p>We&#39;ve got an orientation video, which will cover all the basics.

If you&#39;re using ChimeIn as part of a course, you&#39;ll probably have a &quot;Chime&quot; for each of your courses. Then you can create folders for each lecture or topic, or just create a single folder for your whole semester.</p><p><img src="'+n+'" alt="ChimeIn Organization"></p><h2 id="chime-access" tabindex="-1">Chime access <a class="header-anchor" href="#chime-access" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Chime access&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Every Chime has a custom URL associated with it, as well as an access code.

This will allow you to see names associated with the responses, and will allow participants to access their previous responses.</p>',7),h=[c,r,l];function m(u,d,p,_,f,g){return o(),t("div",null,h)}const w=a(s,[["render",m]]);export{C as __pageData,w as default};
