## Best Practices for Presenters

- Plain text can be read by assistive devices. Do not use screenshots of text.
- Images with alternative text or captions can be read by assistive devices. Include alt text on all images.
- The image submission question type allows participants to add image descriptions which can be read by screen readers. Ask your participants to include an image description with their submission. Model this behavior for users.
