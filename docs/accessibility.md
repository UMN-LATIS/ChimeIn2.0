# Accessibility

We've worked to ensure ChimeIn is accessible to all participants. However, there are a few situations in which ChimeIn might not be usable by all audiences.

For participants using screenreaders, the ChimeIn "participant" interface will announce any changes that occur - for example, opening or closing a question.

## Images and Heatmaps

The "image heatmap" question type is likely to be challenging for participants with visual impairments, and may be challenging for participants with fine motor impairments.

We sometimes see presenters using screenshots of Powerpoint slides instead of plain question text when creating questions. We recommend against this pattern - in addition to accessibility concerns, this approach can be challenging for participants on mobile devices.

The "image submission" question type allows participants to add image descriptions to aid in accessibility when allowing participants to view the submission results directly.

## Accessibility Feedback

We're committed to continuing to enhance the ChimeIn experience for all participants. If you've encountered challenges around accessibility or have concerns, please [get in touch](mailto:latistecharch@umn.edu).
