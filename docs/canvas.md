# Using ChimeIn in Canvas

ChimeIn has direct Canvas integration, which makes it easy to create and manage Chimes.  In addition, ChimeIn can share completion data back to the Canvas gradebook, allowing ChimeIn responses to be used to track attendance or participation.

## Creating a Chime

ChimeIn is available as an "external tool" within the Canvas assignment tool.  When adding an assignment, select ChimeIn from the external tools list.  You can assign a grading basis as well.  We recommend checking the box for "open in a new tab" so your students have plenty of space.

After creating the assignment, click the link to open ChimeIn.  This will automatically create a new Chime within ChimeIn, and add a folder with the same name as your assignment.  Any future assignments you create will automatically have folders created in this Chime as well.  

Add any questions you'd like to your folder.  If you have co-instructors, they will automatically be granted the access to add questions as well.

## Presenting to students

When you're ready to share your questions with your students, have them follow the assignment link within Canvas.  **This is important in order for them to receive credit in the gradebook.**  As the instructor, you can follow the same link to present the questions.  At that point, the process is the same as presenting ChimeIn outside of Canvas.

It can take up to 10 minutes for data from ChimeIn to be passed back to the Canvas gradebook.
