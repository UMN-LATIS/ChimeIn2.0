# Migrating to ChimeIn 2

ChimeIn 2 works a little differently from the original version.  The biggest change is that ChimeIn 2 no longer relies on course enrollment data to provide access.  Historically, this has been the biggest pain-point for faculty - enrollment data can be out of date or incorrect, and it could be complicated to track down issues.  

ChimeIn 2 also uses some new language.  ChimeIn has been used in many non-course situations, so the course-centric interface created confusion.  In ChimeIn 2, you create _chimes_.  Chimes contain folders, and folders contain questions.  You'll never enter a "course designator" or any other course-specific information. 

## Using ChimeIn 2 with a course ##

We're currently testing our [Canvas](/canvas) integration, which dramatically simplifies using ChimeIn with a course.  Although that's not yet available for everyone, you can still use ChimeIn with a course.  See the [Managing a Chime](/managing-a-chime) section for more information on the basics of setting up a Chime and sharing links. 

## Other Changes with ChimeIn 2 ##

The process for using ChimeIn 2 to ask questions is very similar to the original version.  Participants just leave their browser open on page for your Chime and questions will appear automatically when you "open" them.  ChimeIn 2 provides a "present" mode which can be used fullscreen, to better facilitate asking questions in class.
