# Asking Questions with ChimeIn

## Adding Questions

Questions are stored inside of folders.  After you've created your first Folder, click the "new question" button to create a question.

## Anonymous Questions

You can choose to make questions anonymous. In this case, participant names won't be displayed in association with their responses. Keep in mind that identity information is still tracked on the ChimeIn server, so this is not an acceptible option for collecting truly anonymous data. 

## Question Types

ChimeIn currently has 5 question types.  The architecture of ChimeIn allows us to easily add new types of questions, so if you've got an idea for something cool, let us know.

### Multiple Choice

Multiple Choice questions allow you to create responses for participants to select.  You may have as few or as many responses as you want.  Responses will be displayed as bar charts.

### True/False

True/False is a special type of multiple choice, in which the true/false options are pre-created

### Slider

The slider question type allows you to define two endpoints on a slider.  Participants then slide the slider to register their response.  For example, you might have a question asking how well students are understanding a topic, ranging from "Totally Confused" to "Confident I understand".  Responses are presented as a histogram.

### Free Response

Free response questions allow participants to present full-text responses.  They're displayed as both a wordcloud and a "twitter" style feed.  This question type allows participants to add more than one response if they'd like.

### Image Response

The image response allows participants to submit an image, either taken on a mobile device or attached from their computer. Responses will be displayed in a gallery.  You can click each image to magnify it. 

## Question Sessions

Each time you open a question, a session is created to hold responses. When viewing results, you can use the dropdown to select between sessions. By default, results are aggregated and displayed.

The sessions feature allows you to ask a question multiple times, and compare the outcome from each session.  For example, an instructor may ask a question at the beginning of a lecture and again at the end, to track whether opinions have changed.
