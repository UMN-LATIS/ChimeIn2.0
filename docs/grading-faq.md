# FAQ: Canvas Grading

<details id="faq-manual-adjust-chimein-grades">
<summary>How can I manually adjust ChimeIn grades?</summary>

You might have a student with an excused absence, or may want to round up some ChimeIn grades. You can tweak ChimeIn grades in the Canvas gradebook a couple of different ways:

### Edit Canvas Grades Directly

Probably the easiest to **edit the grades directly** in the Canvas gradebook, with a few caveats. ChimeIn automatically re-syncs assignments a few hours after any new responses, so be sure to close questions to avoid new responses which will overwrite your edits.

For example, I could type "ex" in the grade column to excuse a student from the ChimeIn assignment:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ChimeIn will resync an assignment if there are any new responses, so wait
> until all your responses are in and your question is closes before making
> adjustments.

### Separate Column for Adjustments

Another option is to **create a separate grade column** specifically for any ChimeIn point adjustments, and then assign points as needed to that column. Since this is a separate column, you don't need to worry about ChimeIn syncing overwriting your changes.

   <img src="./img/faq-manual-adjustment-new-col.png" alt="The Canvas gradebook contains a column for ChimeIn responses, and another separate column for ChimeIn adjustments. The first user earned 7.5/10 points for ChimeIn, but the instructor rounded up their score to full points by adding another 2.5 points to the ChimeIn adjustments column." width="400" />

<details id="faq-round-assignment-to-full">
  <summary>How can I round up assignment scores to 100%?</summary>

You can use [Curve Grades](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-curve-grades-in-the-Gradebook/ta-p/745) in Canvas to do the adjustment.

This will give any participation full points, and non-participants a zero:

<summary>How can I drop lowest ChimeIn assignment scores?</summary>

If you set up a ChimeIn assignment for each class meeting in Canvas, you may want to permit students to miss a certain number of before it impacts their grades.

You can use [Canvas assignment groups](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-add-an-assignment-group-in-a-course/ta-p/970) to group all your chime assignments together, and then [create a rule to drop the lowest X chimes](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/How-do-I-create-rules-for-an-assignment-group/ta-p/848).
