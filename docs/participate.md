# Participating in a Chime

As a participant in a Chime, you'll be able to respond to questions asked by the presenter. To join a Chime, you'll either follow a link from a Canvas course, another link, or you'll enter a special access code.

If you're accessing ChimeIn via Canvas, it's important that you follow that link each time you want to participate in a Chime. Doing that will ensure you get credit for your participation.

When you load the Chime, there may not be any open questions. Just leave the page open. Whenever your presenter opens a question, it'll appear automatically. You don't need to refresh your browser. Simply enter your response.

You're able to view any of your previous responses in the "past responses" tab.
